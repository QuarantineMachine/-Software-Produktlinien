# Corona Mask Configurator

This project contains my student project for the master lecture "Software-Produktlinien" (summer terms 2020). The purpose is to try out different techniques to create software product lines.



In this project we assume that we are working at an evil company that sells mask to limit the spread of the corona virus with evil business practices. We assume that we are developers who are as evil as our managers and the ceo.

In order to implement an online-shop we develop a feature diagram with mandatory and optional features to present it to our managers and ceo. For customers it has a frontend which looks just normal. The backend however has implemented evil calculations.

Note that this is just a small student project and not a full-fledged implemented shop with fancy frontend. It is just meant to demonstrate how to apply the principles of creating software product lines.
